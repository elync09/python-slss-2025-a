# Create our own Chatbot

# 1. Greet the user with a predetermined statement
greeting = "Hello! I am a chatbot."

# 2. Print the statement
print(greeting)

# 3. Introduce the bot
print("My name is MeGPT.")
print("I'm not like the other chatbots.")
print("I'm completely deterministic.")

# 4. Wow the user with some maths
print("I bet you don't know what 8*8 is.")
print("I can do it.")
print(f"8*8 is actually {8*8}.")
print("What is pi squared?")
print("I'm smart and can do it.")
print(f"It is {3.14 **2}.")

# 5. Get the name of the user and store it
user_name = input("So...what's your name?")
print(f"It's nice to meet you, {user_name}.")

#6. Get the users favourite colour and store it
colour = input("What's your favourite colour?")
print(f"Oh wow, {colour} is also my favourite colour!")

#7. Get the users favourite animal and store it
